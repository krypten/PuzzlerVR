# PuzzlerVR
This was a mini project for my Udacityâ€™s VR Nanodegree. The puzzler game is a challenging memory game that shows the power of VR and proves that VR is safe for all ages and on your stomach :). Using motion, memory, and visual queues you will be entertained and amazed by this demo experience.
